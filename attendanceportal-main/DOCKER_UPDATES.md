# Docker Configuration Updates

This document outlines the improvements made to the Docker configuration for the attendance portal project.

## Frontend Dockerfile Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. **Multi-Stage Build**: Maintained optimized React build with nginx serving
2. **Enhanced Caching**: Package files copied first for optimal layer caching
3. **Security Enhancements**: Non-root user with proper file ownership
4. **Health Checks**: Added health check for frontend service
5. **Production Optimizations**: Environment variables and build optimizations

### Benefits:
- **Security**: Non-root user execution with proper file ownership
- **Performance**: Optimized React build with nginx serving
- **Monitoring**: Health checks for service availability
- **Caching**: Better Docker layer caching for faster builds

## Backend Dockerfile Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. **Production Dependencies**: Only production dependencies installed
2. **Security Enhancements**: Non-root user with proper file ownership
3. **Health Checks**: Added health check with database connectivity
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Memory limits and timezone configuration
5. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and health monitoring

### Benefits:
- **Security**: Non-root user execution
- **Performance**: Production-only dependencies reduce image size
- **Monitoring**: Health checks verify service and database connectivity
- **Resource Management**: Memory optimization for Node.js

## Docker Compose Improvements

### Security Enhancements:
1. **No New Privileges**: Added `security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true` to all services
2. **Read-Only File Systems**: Frontend container runs with read-only root filesystem
3. **Temporary File Systems**: Added tmpfs mounts for temporary files
4. **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits for all services

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health check configurations
2. **Service Dependencies**: Proper service dependency management with health conditions
3. **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Logging Configuration**: Rotating log files with size limits

### Monitoring Improvements:
1. **Structured Logging**: JSON format logging with rotation
2. **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all services
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Memory and CPU limits with monitoring
4. **Network Configuration**: Proper subnet configuration

## Service-Specific Improvements

### MongoDB:
- Added resource limits and logging configuration
- Enhanced health check monitoring
- Proper volume management

### Backend:
- Security optimizations with read-only tmpfs
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Resource limits to prevent memory leaks
- Health checks with database connectivity

### Frontend:
- Read-only filesystem for security
- Optimized nginx configuration
- Temporary file systems for caching
- Health checks for service availability

## Usage

### Building and Running:
```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Monitoring:
```bash
# Check service health
docker-compose ps

# View resource usage
docker stats

# Check logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

### Health Checks:
- **MongoDB**: Database connectivity check
- **Backend**: API health endpoint check
- **Frontend**: Nginx service availability check

## Security Features

1. **Non-Root Users**: All services run as non-root users
2. **Read-Only Filesystems**: Frontend container uses read-only root filesystem
3. **No New Privileges**: Prevents privilege escalation
4. **Temporary File Systems**: Sensitive directories mounted as tmpfs
5. **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

## Performance Features

1. **Layer Caching**: Optimized Docker layer caching
2. **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits for all services
3. **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation
4. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring
5. **Optimized Builds**: Production-only dependencies

## Network Configuration

- **Subnet**: 172.20.0.0/16 for internal communication
- **Bridge Network**: Isolated network for services
- **Port Mapping**: Proper port exposure for external access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper file ownership in Dockerfile
2. **Memory Issues**: Check resource limits in docker-compose.yml
3. **Health Check Failures**: Verify service endpoints are accessible
4. **Build Failures**: Check Dockerfile syntax and dependencies

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Inspect container
docker-compose exec [service-name] sh

# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Verify health checks
docker-compose ps
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Used where beneficial (Frontend)
2. **Security First**: Non-root users and read-only filesystems
3. **Resource Management**: Proper limits and monitoring
4. **Logging**: Structured logging with rotation
5. **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks
6. **Caching**: Optimized layer caching
7. **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions
